## ⌨️ About MKbrrd

Hi — I’m Mike, and I build keyboards for people who care how things *feel*.

By day, I work as a cybersecurity engineer. By night (and weekends… and probably too late into the night), I design and build custom mechanical keyboards under the name **MKbrrd**.  MK could mean Mechanical Key...board, or a combination of “MiKe” + a silly way of saying “board” - either way there you go 😄.

What started as a hobby -- testing switches, playing with circuit and 3d design tools, and obsessing over layout and sound -- slowly turned into something more:  
a small workshop where keyboards are treated like tools *and* art.

## Why Mechanical Keyboards?

A good keyboard disappears.  
A great keyboard makes you *want* to type.

I believe keyboards should be:

*   Comfortable for long sessions   
*   Built to last
*   Tuned for sound and feel
*   Designed with intention, not shortcuts

Every board I make is something I’d happily use myself.

## What I Build

At MKbrrd, I focus on:

*   Custom mechanical keyboards
*   Thoughtful layouts and case design  
*   Using widely known firmware software such as QMK and ZMK
*   Clean, reliable builds with a focus on longevity
    
Some projects are one-offs.  
Some become small-batch designs.  
All of them are built with the same mindset: **no junk, no rush jobs, no mystery parts.**

## Friendly, Human, and Supportive

If you buy a keyboard from me, you’re not buying from a faceless shop.

You’re buying from:

*   Someone you can email or message  
*   Someone who will help if something breaks
*   Someone who enjoys talking about keyboards

I’m always happy to:

*   Answer questions
*   Talk layouts and switches
*   Help with maintenance or upgrades
*   Support what I build after it leaves my hands
    
If you’re new to mechanical keyboards, that’s totally fine.  
If you’re deep in the hobby already, we’ll probably get along great.

## Let’s Talk

Whether you’re:

*   Interested in a keyboard
*   Curious about a design
*   Looking for something custom
*   ... just want to talk shop
    

You’re welcome to reach out.

This is a small operation, built on curiosity, engineering, and a love of well-made things.

Thanks for stopping by —  
and welcome to MKBrrd.


*-Mike*
